<h1> System Analysis: Access to Archival Databases</h1>
<p>Mary Lane</p>
<h2>System Introduction</h2>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), often shortened to the National Archives, is the official archive of the United States. NARA’s mission is to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/about/info/mission">preserve and protect historical records</a> with the aim of empowering Americans to discover the country’s history and engage in public life through these archives. From genealogy to politics, the economy to culture, NARA’s vast archives offer a window into American history and the structure of its documented memory.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill this mission and vision, the National Archives has created a digital archive so users can easily access these historical records. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2003-80">Established in 2003, </a>NARA’s Access to Archival Databases (AAD) is a browser-accessible interface comprised of <a href="https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2003-80">“databases and records that are structured like databases”</a> for users to search over <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/getting-started-guide.html#find">247 million records</a>. The AAD makes accessible to a wide population records ranging from ship passenger records to military enlistment and casualty records. AAD serves as the bridge to the multiple archives from <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/getting-started-guide.html#find">more than 40 federal agencies</a>.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>The AAD is accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and promotes its records to academic researchers, amateur genealogists, and anyone interested in searching for and viewing these electronic governmental records. As the typical user profile is quite broad, the AAD presents simple search and navigational functionalities.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the AAD is a <a href="https://historyhub.history.gov/f/discussions/29176/whats-the-difference-between-nara-s-catalog-and-the-aad">”structured database”</a> which makes available 247 million records and continues to grow with <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/getting-started-guide.html">the addition of new databases</a>. The AAD captures a wide variety of metadata according to the record type and uses the <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/terminology.html#field">archival hierarchy</a> to situate the content (record group and collection are the highest level, which contain series, and series contain file units and/or items).</p>
<p>The AAD contains data from approximately <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/getting-started-guide.html">1% of NARA’s files</a>. It does not display digital scans of paper content, rather searchable data from records chosen “because the records identify specific persons, geographic areas, organizations, and dates.”</p>
<p>NARA provides a <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/terminology.html">terminology</a> section for definitions of AAD terms such as collection identifier, data table, and data type.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Unique/interesting features the system supports (technological description)</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/global-pages/accessibility">All of NARA’s web content</a> is accessible from most web browsers, and is also accessible on mobile devices. The system is well-suited to both the experienced and novice researcher, offering information in chronological sections as well as by content type. For those interested in genealogy, the system is searchable by demographic information. The AAD’s indexes indicate how many records are contained within a series; with the sheer number of files contained with the AAD system, these numbers are a helpful gauge of its volume as well as an interesting peek into the history of recordkeeping in the U.S.! </p>

<h4>Pros and cons of the system</h4>

<h4> Suggestions for improvement:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Simplifying the AAD’s search capabilities: The AAD <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/">emphasizes free-text search</a> over other search methods. Free-text searches are beneficial for use by laypeople. However, free-text searches are most effective when the searched terms are broad. Many researchers are looking for specific data: the AAD does offer widened search capabilities via fielded searches. <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/help.html">Fielded searches</a> allow users to search specific fields, drilling down to more <a href="https://aad.archives.gov/aad/help/help.html#tips-fielded-search">specific data points</a> such as name, demographic identifiers (age, sex, birth date year), and address of record. Alternatively, users can browse by category or subject. While the AAD offers broad and quite specific search capabilities, enhancements to the free text search bar to accommodate multiple variables, or refinements to the “advanced search” function which integrate aspects of the fielded search, could make the user experience a smoother and more enjoyable one for the novice and expert alike.</li>
<li>Consolidation with other governmental archival databases with different formats, such as the National Archives <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov">catalog</a>. While the National Archives catalog is multimedia, offering a single interface to users could streamline the search process, better market NARA’s resources, and provide a more holistic view of its holdings. <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/626166">For example</a>, images from the FEMA photo library entered prior to and through fiscal year 2005 may be accessed via the AAD, while photos between fiscal year 2006 and 2016 are accessible via the NARA Catalog. Consolidating these resources could maximize their impact.</li>
